# Project memory

## Current truth

- `sf` is a new local Go implementation; the legacy factory is not migrated.
- The approved plan and normative state machine live under `docs/plans/`.
- SQLite is the sole application authority; logs and NDJSON are projections.
- DBOS failed its bounded SQLite deadline gate; v1 uses one custom Go engine.
- Guarded mode is first; autonomy waits for the guarded pilot and native proof.
- Docker and Colima are not prerequisites or silent fallbacks.
- On macOS 26.6.2, the native-profile spike rejects `sandbox-exec` for
  autonomous execution: a `setsid`/double-fork child can retain worktree write
  access after its supervisor returns. Guarded/manual remain the trusted
  provider/repository baseline.
- No remote, Nysa mutation, or legacy retirement is currently authorized.
- `sf init` now performs native-only canonical repository registration. Stable
  and dev configuration generations are stored in separate SQLite databases,
  and tickets snapshot exact canonical configuration bytes at start.

### 2026-08-29 — Local v1 implementation begins

Sofia approved the root-authored replacement plan. The local working repository
uses `github.com/nysa-company/sf` provisionally and the branch
`feat/local-factory-v1`. Homebrew Go 1.27.0 was installed because no Go
toolchain existed. The Nysa repository baseline v3 was applied idempotently.
Remote creation/push, Nysa changes, Nysa autonomy, legacy retirement, and
non-development service installation remain separate approval gates.

### 2026-08-29 — DBOS rejected at the declared proof gate

The isolated DBOS Go v1.2.0 spike proved several recovery semantics but a
competing SQLite operation with a 40 ms context deadline waited about 1.03
seconds for the configured busy timeout. This violates the bounded-operation
contract. Per the approved one-day rule, DBOS is rejected for v1 and will not
be a production dependency or receive another proof attempt. The custom Go
engine described in `docs/decisions/0001-workflow-engine.md` is the only runtime
path.

### 2026-08-29 — Native-profile capability verdict

The bounded Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) probe demonstrates selected credential,
Git-control, network, package, and launchd denials, but fails the detached
writer lifecycle probe. It records `autonomous_eligible=false`; no Docker or
Colima fallback was installed or proposed. See ADR 0002.

### 2026-08-29 — Fixture boundary hardening

The deterministic fake GitHub remote reloads durable state under a bounded
portable lock for every operation, persists with unique atomic temporary files,
and requires factory ownership for PR recovery. Provider fixtures sort writes,
reject lexical and symlink worktree escapes, and keep escaped-child probes
observable with a two-second maximum lifetime.

### 2026-08-29 — Durable local project configuration

Project and machine TOML parsing is strict and bounded. `sf init` validates the
local Git root and base branch, creates only owner-private channel paths, and
registers one immutable configuration generation idempotently. SQLite schema
v8 copies that generation's canonical bytes and digest into a ticket when it
enters planning, preventing later repository configuration changes from
changing active-ticket authority.

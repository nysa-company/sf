# `sf` CLI

`sf` is a thin client for one channel-specific local daemon. Ticket lifecycle
commands never open SQLite or mutate workflow state in the CLI. The stable
binary uses the `stable` channel; a development build uses `dev`, so the two
channels have separate sockets and roots.

## Primary verbs

```text
sf submit <ticket.md> --project <name>
sf start <ticket>
sf status [ticket] [--watch]
sf show <ticket> [--json]
sf logs <ticket> [--follow] [--phase <name>]
sf pause <ticket> --operator <identity>
sf resume <ticket> --operator <identity>
sf recover <ticket> [--mode guarded] [--operator <identity>]
sf cancel <ticket> --operator <identity>
sf retry <ticket>
sf take <ticket> --operator <identity>
sf approve <ticket> --operator <identity>
sf reject <ticket> --operator <identity> --reason <text>
sf doctor [--repo <path>]
```

`--json` is available on every command. Human and JSON output are rendered from
the same versioned response envelope. The CLI never invents success: a command
that is not configured returns a typed error, exit code, and one executable
next action.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Requested operation succeeded |
| 2 | Invalid command or input |
| 3 | Operator action is required |
| 4 | Temporary daemon/provider/external wait |
| 5 | Policy or safety refusal |
| 6 | Protocol, schema, or version incompatibility |
| 7 | Internal invariant failure |

## Response grammar

Human errors use this stable shape:

```text
Error: <code>: <message>
Mutation: none
Next: sf-dev daemon run
```

`Next:` appears at most once and is generated from executable argv, not a shell
string. JSON preserves the same `ok`, `mutation`, `error`, and `next_action`
semantics. A next action always contains a non-empty argv.

## Direct setup and diagnostics

`doctor`, `auth status`, `auth login`, `init`, and `providers qualify` are direct
local setup/diagnostic commands. In this development shell they report
`not_configured` with a safe next action; they do not contact a provider, call
`gh`, ask for a token, start a daemon, or mutate workflow state. A production
implementation may wire these commands to the approved local setup adapters
without changing their response grammar.

`daemon run` is the foreground entry point for development and tests. Its
socket-backed lifecycle commands use the channel-specific owner-only socket.

## Operator identity

The daemon authenticates the socket peer. An omitted operator is resolved by
the daemon to the authenticated macOS user; a supplied label must match that
user or a configured local alias. The CLI forwards the label as request data
but cannot elevate or spoof it.
